If you could be anywhere right now, where would you want to be right now? Sipping piña coladas on the beach? In bed? Maybe somehwere in the past or future?  Whatever makes you feel happy right?

## Embracing Chaos: Engineering Life in a Chaotic World


Life is difficult. There’s chaos, random events, and unwanted changes. We’ve all experienced these moments, like the COVID-19 pandemic, having to move over and over again or the end of a relationship. Whether I like it or not, my environment plays a significant role in shaping my experiences. It will affect me and impact the definition of who I am, even when I cannot affect it. But if there’s an opportunity to influence my environment, I should take it.

I’ve felt lost over the years, life can be meaningless and I’m so insignificant in the grand scheme of things. No matter what happens or what I do, in ~7 billion years the Earth will be swallowed up by the sun and eventually, everything succumbs to the heat death of the universe. How do I build a framework to handle my existential dread? Do I handle it?

## Systems and Sensitivity: A Lesson from Differential Equations
I remember studying differential equations in engineering, particularly their applications in modelling signals and systems. These equations are fascinating because they describe how the state of a system relates to its rate of change. This relationship becomes especially illuminating when exploring chaotic systems.
Take the concept of initial conditions. In mathematical systems, given an initial state y_0, the system's evolution depends on that starting point. Chaotic systems, like weather patterns or the infamous butterfly effect, are hyper-sensitive to these initial conditions. A tiny change can lead to dramatically different outcomes.

## Chaos in Motion: The Double Pendulum
The double pendulum is a classic example of a chaotic system, modelled using differential equations and Lagrangian mechanics. Even though I can’t fully explain the math behind it (that’s what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum) is for), its behaviour captivates me. A small change in the pendulum’s initial position or velocity results in a drastically different motion trajectory. This is still a deterministic system, my main point of interest is that the trajectory changes by slightly changing the initial condition of the pendulum (i.e. the position or velocity).

It reminds me of life. A slight miscalculation or a seemingly trivial choice can lead to profound consequences. How often do we encounter situations that appear insignificant at first but snowball into life-altering events? This is chaos theory in motion, mirrored in the decisions we make and the events that shape our lives.

## The Random Walk of Life: Brownian Motion and Decision-Making
Randomness is an inherent part of life. Just as particles in Brownian motion take erratic paths, so too do our lives veer off course due to unforeseen events. These deviations can feel overwhelming. If I live in a chaotic system where random events can derail my plans, what can I do? How do I regain control of my trajectory?

We saw earlier that a small change in a chaotic system can lead to profoundly different outcomes.

## Self-Correction: The Inverted Pendulum and Stability
Some systems have mechanisms for self-correction. Consider the inverted pendulum, a system that balances itself to achieve a steady state. By constantly reading its output and adjusting its input, the system maintains stability. This inspires an idea: what if I could model my life similarly? By regularly measuring where I am against where I want to be, I can make adjustments to navigate toward an "ideal state."

But what is the "ideal state" of life? It’s not a simple question. Systems can be temporal or spatial, with states that exist in the past, present, or future. For humans, the ideal state might include factors like health, emotional well-being, relationships, and goals. However, should the ideal state be static? Eternal bliss, a heaven-like existence where nothing changes, seems appealing.


## Being and Environment: The Wave and the Ocean
Nishitani’s metaphor of the self as a wave in the ocean resonates deeply. A wave exists not in isolation but through its interrelation with the ocean, the wind, and other forces. Similarly, I am not an independent entity. I am my environment, shaped by the people around me, the weather, the state of my surroundings—even whether my room is clean or messy (it’s messy). I also am part of other people’s environment too.
This interconnectedness challenges the notion of control. If I could be anywhere or anyone, what would I choose? And yet, this question misses the point. The answer isn’t about being elsewhere or someone else—it’s about being fully present here and now.

## Accepting the Moment: Eternal Recurrence and Contentment
Nietzsche’s idea of the eternal recurrence asks us to imagine living our lives repeatedly, for eternity. If this were true, would I want to relive my experiences exactly as they are? This philosophical exercise reframes how I view the present. Instead of yearning for a different reality, I embrace this one. To wish to alter the past is, to erase my existence and undo the ripples I’ve made in this world.
If I was sent to hell and banished to suffer for eternity and I want to be in it then am I really in hell? Hell isn’t a place—it’s a state of mind. It’s being in a situation I don’t want to be in. But if I can change my perspective and want to be where I am, even the most challenging circumstances lose their sting. 

What more do I want, than to want to always be me? I don't always want to me, I have regrets but changing my past would be suicide. I'm a product of the events and decisions I (and others) have made in the past. I change any of them, I would not exist, it would be someone else typing this not me.


## Yes: A Daily Commitment
Over the years, I’ve struggled with anxiety, self-doubt and I wonder how I could've made a situation better, I still do. I’ve found a powerful tool to combat them: the commitment to say yes to myself every day. I want to be me. I want to experience this moment fully, whether it’s joyful or painful, mundane or extraordinary.

My happiness is fragile and easily disrupted by change. But meaning, like Nishitani’s metaphorical ocean, derives from context. Similarly, life’s meaning adapts to new circumstances. By embracing the chaos, I find contentment. 

## Conclusion: Choosing to Be Here
Life is a chaotic system. It’s unpredictable, filled with random events and unwanted changes. But it’s also beautiful, interconnected with people, nature, taste, smell and whatever else I experience with my senses. Whether I’m walking in the rain, hiking in the mountains, or going through the motions of daily life, this is my life. And I want to live it fully.
By embracing the chaos and whatever life throws at me, I find peace. By proclaiming “Yes! I want to be here! I want to be me!”, I accept my flaws and my mistakes. This doesn’t mean it’s easy—it doesn’t always work — it’s my armor I wear to face whatever comes my way. Although it isn’t the tool that can solve everything, it’s enough to get me to try. If I could be anywhere right now, then the right answer would be that I want to be here.

Did I really just deploy this website and write this essay that could've easily just been summarised by a MewTwo quote? ... Yes

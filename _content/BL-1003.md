## Mark Manson’s Newsletter: TOO MANY THINGS FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT? {#Mark-Manson}
### THREE THINGS FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT
> Worrying is a cheap replacement for caring.
> Complaining is a cheap replacement for fixing.
> Outrage is a cheap replacement for supporting.

> It’s easy to tear down. It’s much harder to build up.

### TWO THINGS FOR YOU TO ASK YOURSELF
> Where I grew up, we used to say someone was, “All sizzle, no steak.” It meant they made a lot of noise but never actually did anything. Are you all sizzle and no steak? If so, why?

Recommended: Use these as journaling prompts for the week.	

Oh I can totally be "All sizzle, no steak." I think I will announce something I'm working on without actually doing anything or going through with it. For example this website still hasn't been published lmao. I think when I do it, I see it as announcing that I am going to change, I am going to be awesome, I guarantee it... Talk is easy and action is a lot harder.

This website is hard, even though I'm using a template (shoutout to @Soumyajit). I am advertising who I am to the world and I am scared and insecure about how I will get percieved. I need to soldier on though. Good things only happen if you try (@agamator (2021))

What about each of the three statements from Mark?

> Worrying is a cheap replacement for caring.
It's easy to worry, I don't have to put effort in. I can just be the victim of a situation instead of taking responsibility. To care means to take action, to engage with the issue/person/ yourself.

> Complaining is a cheap replacement for fixing.

Again, complaining about a situation, whether unfair or fair to be in shows a lack willingness to take responsibility. It doesn't matter how I got into a situation, ultimately am I responsible for getting out of it? I think of the famous Bojack Horseman clip "It gets easier"

> Outrage is a cheap replacement for supporting.

Oh this can get very controversial, a lot of people have been outraged but don't really support the thing they are outraged of...

What about me? I do get outraged... I'm struggling to think about what though. I've been jaded for the longest of times. 

### ONE THING FOR YOU TO TRY THIS WEEK
Try being constructive towards a problem you’ve made a lot of fuss but failed to do anything about. See how much further that gets you. Then let me know how it goes.

Remember: Small changes lead to lasting breakthroughs. Reply to this email and let me know how it went.

## Welcome to my mind {#Welcome}

Hello, welcome to my first post!

The goal of this website is to start sharing more of my thoughts and document what‚Äôs going on in my head using coherent sentences. 

On top of how I‚Äôve been doing lately, I‚Äôve also picked two fields to discuss: Photography and Philosophical discussions.

### Photography:

I picked photography because I want to get better at creating something novel in the world and well I‚Äôm not very artistically inclined. I thought that I could use my Instagram account to force myself to learn new concepts but I just haven‚Äôt.

I‚Äôll follow the [r/photoshop class](http://www.r-photoclass.com/) and post a picture of the week based on what I‚Äôve learned from the class.

### Philosophical Discussions:

I‚Äôve been following Mark Manson‚Äôs YouTube channel this year, some of you may know Mark from his best-seller, *‚ÄúThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck‚Äù*. I haven‚Äôt read this book‚Ä¶ I should‚Ä¶

Mark has a newsletter, *Your next breakthrough* that requires me to think about an idea for about five minutes and I hope to start regularly answering these using the weekly blog posts.

Over the last couple of months, I‚Äôve been following the [Philosophize This!](https://open.spotify.com/show/2Shpxw7dPoxRJCdfFXTWLE?si=b571b814482248d2) podcast by Stephen West. Stephen uploaded an episode on Thursday but I ran out of time to include in this week's blog post. I'll cover it next week ü§û

However Stephen doesn‚Äôt post weekly so when he does, I‚Äôll try to cover his new episodes and even contribute some of my own thoughts on it.

### More Posts:

I have a couple of ideas for some concepts that I want to explore, hopefully, I can push one of them out by the end of the year ü§û

It‚Äôs incredible how many people have built the tools and infrastructure to make this website come to fruition, especially in the AI era where after a few prompts I could debug any technical issue. Shoutout to the original creator of this Website‚Äôs template [@Soumyajit](https://x.com/Soumyajit4419).

I hope to contribute back likewise one day.

## What happened this week? {#This-week}

I‚Äôm in week 2 of Uni, things started slow but are picking up and deadlines are starting to appear again.

In my probability class, I was exposed to a new way of thinking with the tool of the p-value.

The p-value of an experiment is the likelihood of achieving the value you got (or higher) assuming that the null hypothesis was correct. If the p-value of an observation is.

We were given an example where 12,000 teams are experimenting on a placeobo drug. The null hypothesis would be that the drug does not affect patients with some disease. Therefore the p-value was 0.001 (0.1%) that the drug was effective.

That means that out of the 12,000 teams, we expect only ~12 teams to find evidence to the contrary. However, when the lucky team finds the evidence that the drug is effective, they publish their results while everyone else doesn‚Äôt and now the world thinks this drug is effective when it isn‚Äôt.

And this is how we ended up with people taking Ivermectin instead of vaccines.

Cloud computing has been an information dump, there‚Äôs so much content covered in a lecture and I just can‚Äôt keep up.

## Mark Manson‚Äôs Newsletter Week 1: The Advice Nobody Wants But Everybody Needs {#Mark-Manson}

### Two things for you to think about
Develop the ability to be disliked and free yourself from the prison of other people‚Äôs opinions.

*‚ÄúYou have enemies? Good. That means you‚Äôve stood up for something, some time in your life.‚Äù*

‚Äì Victor Hugo (often mistakenly attributed to Churchill)

### Reflect: Then consider sharing this thought with others.

This is something I struggle with. I try to fit in and be very likeable. I think being someone that is easy to work with and likeable are positive traits but it does mean that sometimes I feel lost as a person.

I take it Mark isn‚Äôt saying I should do something harmful to other people or myself rather I should think critically and stand by the valuation of my mind.

I remember the idea of the "method of doubt" from Ren√© Descartes's philosophy:

> By eliminating all dubitable beliefs, truths would of course be excised along with the false, but then in the re-building of the edifice of knowledge that was to follow those truths would be recovered, free from the errors of the past.

If I can critique an idea, break it down to fundamentals and eliminate all dubitable beliefs then all knowledge left are truths.

Okay so why the tangent Snehin? If I have these newly formed truths that no one else agrees with and maybe even upsets myself or other people, that doesn‚Äôt make these truths go away. My mind is sound and I am willing to be critiqued and proven wrong, I hold onto these truths even if it is a repulsive idea. 

To be free from other people‚Äôs opinions means that I must make all actions, decisions and thoughts based on rationale not because it bodes well with the herd.

### One thing for you to ask yourself

What are three things in your life that you are willing to be disliked for? If you have trouble answering that question, that is a problem.

Recommended: Use these as journaling prompts for the week.

Yeah, this is a problem, not many things I am willing to be disliked for‚Ä¶ From the top of my head, probably my views on Sikhi and the 5 Ks. I trim my beard and recently my hair too. I don‚Äôt wear the turban but idk why I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ Sometimes I think I don‚Äôt deserve it because I‚Äôm not a real sikh or because I‚Äôm still a child‚Ä¶

Yet I still look like a Sikh and don‚Äôt exactly blend in. Being normal sucks anyways, embrace being different and use your distinct perspective to your advantage.

Anyways three things I am willing to be disliked for:

My character
Me asking dumb questions in class
I‚Äôm willing to be disliked if it means prioritising myself ahead of 

Thing is, I don‚Äôt think any rationale person will dislike me for the points listed above.

## Photo of the Week {#Photo-of-the-Week}

### Assignment
Since we haven‚Äôt really started yet, let‚Äôs have a fun assignment. It shouldn‚Äôt take too long, and everyone who has ever taken a photo can participate. There are three parts:

First, I want you to go dig in your archives and post the favourite photo you ever took. There is no criterion of subject or camera, simply post the one that makes you proudest. Either upload it to imgur or to flickr, but please make sure it is reasonably big (900√ó750 pixels is a good default size). If you have trouble with the upload, ask in the comments.

I like astronomy and sometimes I want to go back in time and study Astronomy instead of Engineering and now Data Science‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always enjoyed watching documentaries about the Universe on National Geographic or PBS Space Time on YouTube. I want to be a rocket man!

I took this picture in Cape Town through the Franschhoek fires' smoke. I was so confused about life when I took this (Feb 2021?), but hey I‚Äôm always confused ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I love who I was during that period (Dec 2020 to March 2021). 2020 was a traumatic year; this picture reminds me that I have a life to live life and how meaningless it all is. In the grand scale, so many things are pointless‚Ä¶

The best photo I've seen this week has to be this though:

Well done to all the runners and Letsile Tebogo has a bright future ahead üåç üáßüáº

And that wraps up week 1!

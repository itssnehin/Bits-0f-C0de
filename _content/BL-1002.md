## What happened this week? {#This-week}

I missed week 2 and since this week has been so... entertaining.. I think I should just talk about this week üòä

Last weekend my sister was in town to celebrate her birthday.

My last two weeks have been filled with social events, I had dinner with the UQ Vegan Club and met with some friends last night for some trivia (we passed with a solid 50/100 and didn't come last üéâ).

On Monday, I took part in the UQ Social Running Club annual donut dash and pulled off quite a miracle, with a personal record on the 5km run!

This was a miracle run, because it was raining, I ate a bunch of candy prior to the run and fell ill, I was recovering from an injury and it was my first week running at a fast pace.
Actually after the run, I had a cold for the rest of the week. I don't know how my body pulled off a PB but hey üçª.

At dance we learned salsa and it was fun but a really basic class. I missed this weeks lesson, because of said cold. I've been in the Zouk troupe for the last few weeks and every week we learn new comcepts and refine older ones learned in previous weeks. My psyche in Zouke is so shit at the moment. 

And finally, my housemate (Cein) attacked my other housemate and I because he's a paranoid dip shit. I called the police and I thought, "I'm in a first world country, surely they'll respond" but they took two hours to arrive and said they can't do much about it... Kudos to them for actually following up though, they contacted the RTA and my landlord to file a report.
If this was SAPS, I'd have needed to call them multiple times and bribe someone to get anything done... Although, I've never been in this situation in South Africa...

Every day since then, Cein leaves the front door wide open Idk what he wants to accomplish? Landlord told him he has to go by Sunday ü§û. I think I'm going to follow through on the case with the RTA.

Cein is actually the wrote "Keep the doors locked"...

## Mark Manson‚Äôs Newsletter: What are you waiting for? {#Mark-Manson}

### Two Things for you to think about:
>Most people tell themselves that if they felt better, they‚Äôd do the thing‚Äîwhen it‚Äôs actually doing the thing that makes you feel better.
>At some point, you realize that the permission you‚Äôve been waiting for all along was your own.

>Reflect: Then consider sharing this thought with others.

This is such a rough week for self love, but we soldier on. I've had many excuses to say I don't have the time this week due to deadlines, colds and politics and I've overcome all of it.
It's all done now, and this blog is me taking the time to do something that would make me feel better! A busy week is exactly what I wanted from moving to Australia and I got that.

I'm glad I stayed on campus to type this up and to keep the self love going, I plan to cycle to Manly on Sunday.

### TWO THINGS FOR YOU TO ASK YOURSELF
What have you wasted time waiting for ‚Äúthe right‚Äù time before doing? What have you excused or neglected in your own life for no other reason than you felt undeserving of it?

Recommended: Use these as journaling prompts for the week.	

The fucking gym. For the last three years, I have been inconsistently gyming and the result is the lack of progress. I'm still skinny fat and I've lost strength at the gym over the last two years. I've been consistent recently (besides this week) and I need some results. I feel like I don't deserve the confidence of going to the gym and regularly failing to lift (that's the goal right? Push till failure?)

ONE THING FOR YOU TO TRY THIS WEEK
Give yourself permission. F*ck it. F*ck everybody. It‚Äôs your life. Go live it. Then let me know how it goes.

### ONE THING FOR YOU TO TRY THIS WEEK
Cut one thing out of your life that dramatically improves it. Let me know how it goes.

Remember: Small changes lead to lasting breakthroughs. Reply to this email and let me know how it went.

## Photo of the Week {#Photo-of-the-Week}

It was actually tough to picka a photo of the Week this week.

This stands out though, seeing thousands of people who left their home in search of a better life (just like me) and celebrating together.
